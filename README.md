# Neural_Network_C++
A Neural Network in C++, with just one hidden layer... Make your own training data and train your Neural Network to get the desired output... The applications are endless, from using QT to make a replica of Quick Draw to implementing Neuroevolution...

# nn.h
This header file contains all the neural network operations like randomizing weights and tweaking them using backpropagation and gradiel descent which are implemented as matrices... (Even vectors could ve used, but matrices were simpler to use)

# matrix.h
Contains all the functions for all matix operations including the activation functions (relu, sigmoid)...

# main.cpp
Driver program to test and use the Neural Network Library....

Modify it and use it to your will!!! Contribution by: Valluri Pavan Preetham...
